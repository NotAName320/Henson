Henson (**H**euristic and **E**xtensible **N**ation**S**tates **O**rganizer for 
**N**ations) is a puppet manager for NationStates. The core principles for 
Henson are:
1. **To be easy to use.** If one can play NationStates, they should be able to 
easily learn and understand how to use Henson.
2. **To be powerful.** Henson should be able to enable NationStates players with 
large amounts of puppets for various reasons (raiding/defending, card farming, 
or just a general obsession with the game) to do awesome things that may be 
limited for them by the websiteâ€™s interface.
3. **To be rules-compliant.** Henson should ideally follow all API and website 
restrictions at all times, including complying with rate-limits, restricted 
actions, and prohibited actions. That means not only ensuring that the tool 
complies with all restrictions if used correctly, but eliminating the 
possibility of abuse by safeguarding the program from performing illegal actions 
if used maliciously.
4. **To be fun.** Henson should never take the fun out of NationStates, no matter 
what players use it for.

## Installation (Windows)
1. Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/NotAName320/Henson/releases) and 
download the latest version.
2. Extract and run! It should work without having to install anything, but you 
may need the latest version of the .NET 6.0 Desktop Runtime, which you can 
download [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0).

## Installation (Linux)
1. First, make sure you have the latest version of the .NET runtime or SDK 
installed on your system, which you can do via your package manager. **DO NOT 
INSTALL IT VIA SNAP, IT'S BROKEN AND IT SUCKS.**
2. Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/NotAName320/Henson/releases) 
and download the latest version.
3. Extract the files to a directory of your choice, then run 
`chmod +x ./Henson` in that directory.
4. Run `./Henson` or double click the Henson file. Enjoy!

## Installation (MacOS)
Uh, you're on your own here. I've provided the binaries for both x64 and ARM 
Macs, but I don't have the hardware to test either. If someone has a Mac and 
successfully got Henson to work, please contact me and tell me how you did it! 
(or even better file a pull request)
