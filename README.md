Henson (**H**euristic and **E**xtensible **N**ation**S**tates **O**rganizer for 
**N**ations) is a puppet manager for NationStates. The core principles for 
Henson are:
1. To be easy to use. If one can play NationStates, they should be able to 
easily learn and understand how to use Henson.
2. To be powerful. Henson should be able to enable NationStates players with 
large amounts of puppets for various reasons (raiding/defending, card farming, 
or just a general obsession with the game) to do awesome things that may be 
limited for them by the website’s interface.
3. To be rules-compliant. Henson should ideally follow all API and website 
restrictions at all times, including complying with rate-limits, restricted 
actions, and prohibited actions. That means not only ensuring that the tool 
complies with all restrictions if used correctly, but eliminating the 
possibility of abuse by safeguarding the program from performing illegal actions 
if used maliciously.
4. To be fun. Henson should never take the fun out of NationStates, no matter 
what players use it for.
